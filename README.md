# SQL-insert-statements

Java code that takes as input the name of a table and lines of comma-separated data values that represent tuples you would like to insert into that relation or table through SQL, and returns SQL insert statements including these data values accordingly.

This can be useful if you choose to setup the tables with the values in Excel. You can save the file as a csv file, take the lines from this csv file representing the tuples and paste them as input for the code. This can help save a good deal of time as you would not have to create the insert statements manually.
